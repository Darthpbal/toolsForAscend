# toolsForAscend
Here are some small tools for helping out the Phoenix College NASA Ascend team




In order to use these tools, you must have a C++ compiler installed and to use
the Makefile features, you must have make installed.

If on linux, this is simple, simply open a terminal using crtl-alt-t and type
the following command and press enter


```
sudo apt-get install make g++ -y
