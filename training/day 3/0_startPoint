    We'll code on a desktop today, then add the extra complicated layer of a smaller computer tomorrow.

    Today we'll cover features of the C++ programming language.

    C++ programs are instructions for computers to carry out

    The weakness is, computers don't know what you INTEND! They only do EXACTLY WHAT YOU TELL THEM!




    How programming actually works, we already know plainly well that computers think in binary, not english.

    High level languages like C++ are built up to be able to represent computer functions using more human understandable.

    C++ is a high level language that is written, and then it is 'compiled' or translated into binary.

    During this translation or 'compilation' the code syntax, equivalent to a speaking language punctuation, is checked to make sure it's correct.

    Assuming the syntax is correct, the code is compiled into a binary file that is optimized for the processor that will run the program.





    Workflow:
        1. What is the problem?
        2. Design program flow (conceptual steps)
        3. Write code
        4. Compile code
        5. Run program
        6. Observe program behavior / compare to expected behavior.
        7. Debug / modify code to fit expectations
        8. repeat 4 - 6 until program exhibits desired functions.




hello world:
    We'll deconstruct a basic "hello world"
    hello world programs are used for
        demonstrating the action of compiling
